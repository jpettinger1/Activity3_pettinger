ISQA 3900 Activity 3 by Jacob Pettinger

/lumber.py
This is the main and only method for the program, it takes two different numbers from a user to calculate the total
price of a batch of lumber they are to purchase. The two numbers are the amount of lumber in feet the user wants to
purchase, and the grade of lumber they are purchasing. These two numbers are used to calculate the final cost, which if
it reaches certain thresholds allows for discounts to be applied to the final total. The final total is given to the
user and they are prompted to ascertain if they'd like to continue using the calculator or not.
